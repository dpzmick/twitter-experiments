This experiment will track all activity around a specific user.
Retweets, mentions, and original tweets will be included.

This can data can later be used to follow a single tweet around. This is
preferred to waiting until a users posts a tweet, then pulling information, as
it allows for data collection at once. I can track multiple tweets and their
retweets instead of single tweets.
