[ Opening slide ]
Introduce project:
    - Started doing experiments
    - What here is interesting
    - Let curiosity be my guide

Begin Prediction:
    - Prediction with sentiment, interesting but,
    - What else is there? -> Geographic data
    - Map map of tweets about the flu
        - Fever, flu tracked terms

Nate Silver's Book, The Signal and the Noise
    - Prediction Hard. Understand more about Twitter.
        - Others lumped everything together.
    - Got pulled towards Structure of Twitter.
        - How are accounts connected
        - where is information stored

[ Next Slide: graph ]
    - Rough graph showing the connections in my Twitter network.
    - This may be harder than expected
    - Need to simplify.
        - Look only at retweets
        - Look at only 5 accounts
        - Metrics
            - Lifespan
                - How long a tweet remains important
                - Determined: less than 10 retweets per hour -> dead
            - Indirect Retweets
                - To see how far information gets
            - Average number of retweets for every tweet
            - Number of followers

[ Next Slide: Parabola Plot ]
    - y-axis: indirect retweets
    - x-axis: number of followers
    - bubble size: average number of retweets for a tweet by account.
    - Sweet spot.
    - More retweets !-> tweet gets farther into the network.
    - possible confounding variable: more followers -> less likely to get
      retweeted by someone that is not a follower.
    - More retweets or more depth more important?
    - Pick one:
        - Depth
        - Retweets

[ Next slide: lifespan plot ]
    - y-axis: indirect retweets
    - x-axis: lifespan.
    - Again, more retweets or more depth?
    - Longer life -> less depth
    - Pick two:
        - Lifespan
        - retweets
        - Depth

Conclusion
    - Twitter is interesting
    - Process interesting.
        - How ideas connect
        - naive excitement -> despair -> new idea -> naive excitement
