[ Opening slide ]
Introduce project:
    - Looked for interesting data.
    - Picked Twitter
        - Real time
        - "Cool"

Looked for ideas:
    - Prediction with Twitter?
        - Naive excitement
            - this will be so cool
            - so many cool things can be predicted.

Begin Prediction:
    - Prediction with sentiment.
    - What else is there? -> Geographic data
    - Map map of tweets about the flu [ Next slide: flu map ]

Nate Silver's Book, The Signal and the Noise
    - Prediction Hard. Understand more about Twitter.
        - Naive excitement eliminated
    - Structure of Twitter.
        - How are accounts connected
        - where is information stored
        - where does information enter and leave the system?
    - Focus shifted, naive excitement again about this new course.

    - [ Next Slide: graph ]
    - Rough graph showing the connections in my Twitter network.
    - Result is expected.
    - After looking at this, realized this may be harder than expected

Continued attempts to understand what exactly twitter is:
    - Started collecting Tweets

[ Next Slide: Parabola Plot ]
    - Small number of data points.
    - y-axis: average percentage of retweets by people not directly following
      account (intended to represent how far a tweet's information gets)
    - x-axis: number of followers
    - bubble size: average number of retweets for a tweet by account.
    - Sweet spot.
    - possible confounding variable: more followers -> less likely to get
      retweeted by someone that is not a follower.
    - More retweets !-> tweet gets farther into the network.
    - More retweets or more depth more important?

[ Next slide: lifespan plot ]
    - y-axis: again, percentage out of network
    - x-axis: lifespan. How long a tweet stays relevant.
        - If a tweet does not get retweeted 10 times in an hour, it is said to
          no longer be relevant.
        - Seems extreme
        - Very close to my own determination.
    - Again, more retweets or more depth?

[ Next slide: Most tweet behavior ]
    - Most retweets happen immediately. Drop of quickly

[ Next slide: Some cool examples ]
    - Question, how would we create this behavior?
