[ Opening slide ]
Introduce project:
    - Curiosity guided experiments with Twitter
    - First experiment, prediction using sentiment and geographic data
    - Prediction Hard. Understand more about Twitter.
        - Others lumped everything together.
    - Got pulled towards Structure of Twitter.
        - How are accounts connected
        - where is information stored

- Let me jut try something, see what happens
[ Next Slide: graph ]
    - Rough graph showing the connections in my Twitter network.
    - Need to simplify.
        - Look only at retweets
        - Look at only 5 accounts
        - Look at layers
            - Many Accounts, Single Account, Tweet
    - Metrics
        - Lifespan
            - How long a tweet remains important
            - Determined: less than 10 retweets per hour -> dead
        - Indirect Retweets
            - To see how far information gets
        - Average number of retweets for every tweet
        - Number of followers

[ Next Slide: Rects ]
    - Look at single account
    - Each rect: tweet
    - Size: Lifespan multiplied by number of retweets
    - Darker color -> greater % of retweets indirect
    - Very easy to pick out tweets that may be interesting

[ Next Slide: Korea Tweet ]
    - Individual Tweet
    - Retweets over time
    - Yellow: retweets indriect
    - Red: Retweets Direct
    - Most tweets mostly red, drop off very quickly
    - This one is different, interesting
        - Nature of twitter

[ Next Slide: Parabola Plot ]
    - Many Accounts
    - y-axis: indirect retweets
    - x-axis: number of followers
    - bubble size: average number of retweets for a tweet by account.
    - Sweet spot.
    - More retweets !-> tweet gets farther into the network.
    - possible confounding variable: more followers -> less likely to get
      retweeted by someone that is not a follower.
    - More retweets or more depth more important?

Conclusion
    - Could work back up, use to make predictions
    - Other Applications
        - Marketing
        - Predicting trends.
    - Thanks!
