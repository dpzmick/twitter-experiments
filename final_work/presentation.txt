[ Opening slide ]
Introduce project:
    - Began looking for some interesting source of data
    - Picked Twitter
        - Real time, seems relevant to here and now.

Looked for ideas:
    - Prediction with Twitter?
    - Began to look at making predictions using sentiment.
    - Looked for other interesting data inside Twitter, I became interested in
      Geographic data.
    - Map map of tweets about the flu [ Next slide: flu map ]

Nate Silver's Book, The Signal and the Noise
    - Realized that making predictions with Twitter will be difficult unless a
      greater understanding of what twitter actually is was gained.
    - Became curious about the structure of Twitter. How are accounts connected,
      where is information stored, where does information enter and leave the
      system?
    - [ Next Slide: graph ]
    - This is a rough graph showing the connections in my Twitter network. I
      have no idea where I am here
    - Shows what you would expect, large clusters with some connections between
      them.

Continued attempts to understand what exactly twitter is:
    - Started collecting Tweets from a couple of accounts and doing some
      analysis of them.

[ Next Slide: Parabola Plot ]
    - Make note about awareness of small number of data points.
    - y-axis: average percentage of retweets by people not directly following
      account (intended to represent how far a tweets information gets)
    - x-axis: number of followers
    - bubble size: average number of retweets for a tweet by account.
    - possible confounding variable: more followers -> less likely to get
      retweeted by someone that is not a follower. Very well could be
      explanation of trend.
    - Apparently, more retweets does not mean a tweet gets farther into the
      network.
        - Is it more important to get far away from your direct followers or get
          retweeted a bunch?

[ Next slide: lifespan plot ]
    - y-axis: again, percentage out of network
    - x-axis: lifespan. How long a tweet stays relevant.
        - If a tweet does not get retweeted 10 times in an hour, it is said to
          no longer be relevant. That seems extreme, but it tended to get about
          the same thing I got inspecting the data myself, in most cases.
    - Question, is it better to stay around for a long time or get far away from
      your direct followers?

[ Next slide: Most tweet behavior ]
    - Most tweets tend to get retweeted mostly immediately after the initial
      tweet, then drop of quickly

[ Next slide: Some cool examples ]
    - However, some tweets have different kinds of behavior.
    - Question, how would we create this behavior?
