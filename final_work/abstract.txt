Using Twitter and other social media to make predictions and business
decisions could be valuable, but transforming a complex social network
into useful data is not an easy task. To leverage the data, we first must find a
way to extract some signal from all the noise present in the social network. The
exact definition of signal is project dependent, but it may be possible,
regardless of the project, to find signal by uncovering how different people are
connected and how information moves through these connections. With an
understanding of a social network's structure, analysts can focus specifically
on areas of the network through which important information moves.

Effective visualization of a social network can help create insight into this
structure. To create effective visualizations, it is useful to break the network
down into "layers."

---

The first layer of interest is the information layer. Here we need a
visualization that examines how single piece of information moves and behaves in
the network. On Twitter, the unit of information is a Tweet, and the
information moves when a Tweet is retweeted. This visualization creates some
insight into the nature of the system, and helps pinpoint Tweets that may be
interesting to examine. For example, generally the number of retweets per hour
for any given Tweet is initially high, but very quickly drops off. This indicates
that information on Twitter generally moves the most when it is introduced into
the system, then quickly becomes uninteresting to Twitter users and fades.

---

The next layer is a logical grouping of pieces of information. In Twitter, this
is an account. A visualization of this layer will examine which Tweets posted by
someone are actually signal, and what Tweets are ultimately unimportant. An
effective visualization at this layer also must expose something about the
nature of the accounts (Do they post many meaningless Tweets and a few important
ones, or mostly important Tweets).

---

The final layer is the network as a whole, or some subset of it. In Twitter,
this means finding a compact way to visualize many accounts simultaneously. This
visualization makes it possible to select accounts of interest out of a list of
accounts and find accounts that have similar behavior.

---

With these visualizations it should be possible to explore the Twitter network
and gain some insight into the structure of social networks so that predictions
can be made looking at more signal than noise.
