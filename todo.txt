Visualization:
    - Percentage Graph (What percent of retweets come from direct followers)
      Divided bar chart
    - Chart showing "range" of tweet
    - Chart showing volume of tweet
    - Chart showing growth of followers

Technical Issues:
    - Faster way to find retweets
        - Continue tuning queries
    - Find better way to store tweets in mongo
    - cleanup old storage
    - Move graph to db, build continuous graph tool
        - Run a couple of queries on each user in list, update database entry.
          Cycle through accounts and users
